The issue might be caused by several factors.  To resolve this, ensure the following:

1. **Parent element dimensions:** Make sure the parent element has explicitly defined width or a mechanism to determine its width (e.g., `width: 100%;` or a fixed width).
2. **Unit consistency:** Within the `calc()` function, ensure the units are used consistently.  Mixing percentages and pixels, without proper consideration, can lead to issues.
3. **Specificity:** Check that the CSS rules affecting the element's width are correctly specified and do not conflict with other rules that might override the `calc()` function.
4. **Box-sizing:** Ensure box-sizing is set accordingly. If `box-sizing: border-box;` is used, padding and border are included in the element's total width calculation.

Here's an example of how to correctly implement this:

```css
.parent {
  width: 500px; /* Or width: 100%; */
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Example, adjust as needed */
}

#element {
  width: calc(50% - 20px);
  box-sizing: border-box;/* Example, adjust as needed */
}
```
By addressing these points and providing a well-defined parent element width, the `calc()` function should work as expected.
