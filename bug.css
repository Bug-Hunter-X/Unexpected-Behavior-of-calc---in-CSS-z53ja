The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected.  I'm trying to calculate the width of an element based on its parent's width, but the calculation doesn't seem to be happening correctly. 
```css
#element {
  width: calc(50% - 20px);
}
```
The element's width is not 50% of its parent's width minus 20px.
